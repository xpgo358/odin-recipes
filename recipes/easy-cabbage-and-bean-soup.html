      <li>2 leeks, white and light green parts only, chopped</li>
      <li>3/4 cup sliced carrots</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 1/2 quarts low-sodium vegetable broth</li>
      <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried Italian herb seasoning</li>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add leeks and carrots,
        and cook, stirring frequently, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook
        until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add oil to a heavy-bottomed pot, and heat on high until oil is
        shimmering. Add beef in a single layer, and sear until a nice brown
        crust forms, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in vegetable broth, stir in tomato paste and Italian seasoning, and
        bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until vegetables
        are tender, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using an immersion blender, puree the vegetables and liquid. Season with
        salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        ncrease heat to medium and bring to a boil. Stir in cabbage, red pepper
        flakes, and a couple more pinches of salt, if desired. Bring to a boil,
        reduce heat, and simmer until cabbage is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir
        in beans and simmer until beans are heated through, about 5 minutes
        more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve warm, garnished with fresh thyme sprigs, if desired, and drizzled
        with olive oil.
